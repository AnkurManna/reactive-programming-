process data in realtime

Java Stream vs Reactive Stream 
1 . Java Streams, however, are typically synchronous and work with a finite set of data.Theyâ€™re essentially a means of iterating over a collection with functions.
2 .Reactive Streams support asynchronous processing of datasets of any size, including infinite datasets. 
They process data in real time, as it becomes available, with backpressure to avoid overwhelming their consumers .
